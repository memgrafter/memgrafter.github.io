If you've ever written software regularly, and even if you haven't, you've probably come across the term 'coder'. A Software Engineer or Software Architect in today's world would not generally want to include the word coder in their description. It cheapens the craft.  Instead, they rely on terms that draw analogy to distinguished archaic professions, such as engineer and architect, both of which mean the same thing, roughly 'to contrive', and have nothing to do with engines or arches. So, if you go full circle, it's both: completely contrived and quite reasonable.

If you hop off the train at Montgomery Station in San Francisco, you'll find the [Mechanics' Institute Library and Chess Club](https://www.milibrary.org/about-us/history-and-mission/) around the corner and up an elevator. Still haunted by members of Mycroft Holmes' Diogenes Club, the library offers a technical catalog and periodical publications. Probably primarily, it offers a quiet and inexpensive third place for local people.

Wikipedia states that Mechanics were 'civil and mechanical engineers' of the Industrial Revolution, but it doesn't strike true to me that anyone actually identified directly as a mechanic.  Perhaps the winners of [Medals of the San Francisco Mechanics' Institute](https://pcns.org/paper/pdf_pprs/PCNSpprs2024/2mecExpo.pdf) can shed some light. One such Industrial Exhibition award, found on ebay, is for 'Best Display of Trunks Bags and SATCHELS.' Another is for electric motors for street rails, a third for riveted overalls by Levi Strauss & Co.  Numerous exhibition records are available in the [MI Library Digital Archives](https://www.milibrary.org/research-and-resources/archives/). Another through line is 'mechanical arts' which apparently refers to any sort of physical labor 'requiring knowledge', the definition of knowledge being a potentially controversial dividing line for people who perform labor.

The [Mechanics' Institutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics%27_institute) were ad hoc Victorian colleges and lending libraries. The primary aim was to spread scientific and technological knowledge to everyone, perhaps we can call the main focus 'skilled tradespeople' in today's language. They needed to extend their knowledge of chemistry, electicity, machinery, and other similar things to produce work.

So, of course, I want to know: 'Who were the coders?'  As our era of handwritten code draws to a close, we may see a similar transformation.  In two hundred years, will people look back and ask: 

> Who were the working people hand transcibing things to machines between the early 1900s and 2025?
