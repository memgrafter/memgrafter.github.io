Provenance: **Handwritten**

Writing software has changed a lot for me in the past three years.

I was not, at first, an "innovator" of llm coding technologies, partly because of work policies, and perhaps because of my approach: I think I am an "early adopter" by habit, pragmatically waiting for the innovators to strike gold.

I stopped writing 99% of code by hand in April 2025, partly because I left a job with a rigid policy against machine-generated code, and partly because the llm coding tooling started to succeed on some deep cases.

## My LLM Coding Progression

- **2023-2024:** I prompted the LLM to give me a general "form" (with many errors) and **then manually wrote software off the form with my own expertise**, reducing cognitive load by shedding my "view" of the layout, although I did have to envision it. Sometimes I could manually fix a general form then move it into a file.
- **2025 April:** I used Aider, **manually running shell `!commands`** to provide the LLM context, added whole files, and allowed the LLM to add whole files to the context via a small page-ranked guide called a "repo map". Aider effectively had write, edit, whole-file-read, and human-managed-bash. It wrote 99% of the software I built.
- **2025 November:** I moved to claude code. The LLM can access the shell itself via "agentic tool use". **It can add context faster, with less waste, and with more precision than me.** I am not a supporter of closed ecosystems and I left claude code.  
- **2025 December:** I wrote the first version of [flatagents+flatmachines](https://github.com/memgrafter/flatagents), a truly spec-driven software for LLMs to code LLM workflows. This is my take on an agentic orchestrator -- it deserves its own post.
- **2026 January:** I moved to pi.  **Pi uses the same 4 tools as Aider, now all managed by the LLM: bash, read, write, edit.** The human can still run bash !commands, but it's much more infrequent.  Pi is more flexible and ergonomic software than other tools I have used, and it may last longer.


## Thoughts

- Claude code didn't innovate on the 4 main tools of Aider, and I am not sure if its tool use training *fundamentally changed* model tool use. I think it probably had a very large positive effect on how often the model will use tools unprompted, not how well they use tools overall.  Other tool use APIs overall have been a mixed bag. Claude's models are simply more reliable at this than other models (excepting gpt-5.3-codex).
- Claude code CLI has tried many innovations, mostly useless. Waste is the price of being an innovative actor, I suppose I try not to pay it much -- I don't think that is good, but I don't think it is bad either. We all have limited time and burning it on innovative thinking shares properties with gambling. But then, so does vibe coding. Study the payout schedule carefully.
- I wonder how well LLMs could use tools if other API providers didn't follow Claude Code down the garden path.  I wrote several early tools as [AiderX Handlers](https://github.com/robbintt/aiderX/tree/main/aider/extensions/handlers), and the non-tool use LLMs can call them just fine. In an alternative timeline, or perhaps the near future, we may use cut-to-fit models for each particular tool. This approach is probably 32x cheaper (most savings come from reduced context window), more time-efficient, and more accessible in terms of model training cost. You can even use natural language to tell a SLM (Small Language Model) what and how to use the tool, and you can train it for a particular tool.
